        <h1>Ingredients for Roti</h1>
        <p1>Wheat Flour,Salt,Water and Oil</p1>
            <h1>Step1:</h1>
            <p1>1.Use a flat plate with wide boundaries, or a large bowl to knead the dough for your rotis. Reserve a 1/4 cup of the wheat atta for dusting, and add the rest to the plate, or bowl.</p1>
            <h1>Step2:</h1>  
            <p1>Add ¼ cup of the lukewarm water and begin mixing the wheat flour and water with your hands. Continue to slowly add more water as you knead the dough. </p1>
            <h1>Step3:</h1>
            <p1>By now, the dough will begin to form. After all the flaky bits of atta are gone, use your hands to knead the dough firmly but gently. </p1>
            <h1>Step4:</h1>
            <p1>Use your knuckles to press down, then pull and fold the dough over. Repeat for 3-4 minutes until the dough feels softer and easier to work with.</p1>
            <h1>Step5:</h1>
            <p1>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and allow it to rest for up to 15-20 minutes.</p1>
            <h1>Step6:</h1>
            <p1>Once the dough has rested for around 10 minutes, you can begin pre-heating your tawa or skillet on medium heat. </p1>
            <h1>Step7:</h1>
            <p1>.As the tawa heats up, remove the dough from the plate and roll it into a long, cylindrical shape. Take small pieces of the dough and roll them into a ball with your palms. Leave them aside and continue until all the dough is used up. </p1>
            <h1>Step8:</h1>
            <p1>.Now place the balls of dough onto a rolling board pre-dusted with dry whole wheat atta. Use a rolling pin to flatten the dough into the shape of a roti (flat disc). Sprinkle some more flour on the roti if it sticks to the rolling board or pin. </p1>
            <h1>Step9:</h1>
            <p1>Once you have flattened the roti to your desired thickness, make sure the Tawa is hot, and on high heat. Gently place your roti on the hot Tawa and wait until small bubbles form on the surface of the roti. </p1>
            <h1>Step10:</h1>
           <p1>Flip the roti to allow the other side of the roti to cook, then remove it from the Tawa. Flip it a couple of times more if you feel it is undercooked.</p1>
           <h1>Step11:</h1>
           <p1>.Use a teaspoon of Aashirvaad Svasti Ghee and apply it to the fresh soft roti and repeat the same process for all rotis. </p1>
